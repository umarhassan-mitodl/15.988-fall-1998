description: Reading assignment. This paper is the second in a continuing series of
  papers designed to enhance the reader?s modeling skills. Modeling Exercises Section
  2 contains two separate modeling exercises. In the first exercise the reader will
  build a system dynamics model based on a detailed description of an urban system.
  The reader will run the urban model under varying conditions. The second exercise
  asks the reader to perform mental simulations on a pre-built model, and to estimate
  the model behavior under different conditions. The reader is expected to have prior
  experience with system dynamics, model building, and mental simulation.
