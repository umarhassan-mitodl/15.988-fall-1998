description: 'Reading assignment. Building a System Dynamics Model is a series of
  papers written to demystify the model building process. This paper is the first
  in the series and explains the first stage of the model building process called
  conceptualization. The paper examines in depth the following steps of conceptualization:
  define the purpose of the model; define the model boundary and identify key variables;
  describe the behavior or draw the reference modes of the key variables; and diagram
  the basic mechanisms, the feedback loops, of the system.'

Reading assignment. Building a System Dynamics Model is a series of papers written to demystify the model building process. This paper is the first in the series and explains the first stage of the model building process called conceptualization. The paper examines in depth the following steps of conceptualization: define the purpose of the model; define the model boundary and identify key variables; describe the behavior or draw the reference modes of the key variables; and diagram the basic mechanisms, the feedback loops, of the system.
